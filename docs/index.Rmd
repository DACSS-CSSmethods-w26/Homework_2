# Homework 2: Social Networks in R

## Kayla Freeman

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I. Getting Ready:

* Set seed

```{r}
set.seed(1111)
```



### II. Network Creation from dataframes


```{r}
## link to file on GitHub
fileLink='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DACSS-CSSmethods-w26/Homework_2/refs/heads/main/hollywood.graphml'

library(igraph) # package needed

#read in the graph file
actors=read_graph(fileLink,format='graphml')

```


## III. Exploration of Network nodes

Let's compute measures for each node, and save them into a data frame:


```{r}

#compute eigenvector
eigen=eigen_centrality(actors)$vector

#compute closeness
close=closeness(actors,normalized=T)

#compute betweeness
betw=betweenness(actors,normalized=T)

#create a centrality dataset
DFCentrality=as.data.frame(cbind(eigen,close,betw),stringsAsFactors = F)
names(DFCentrality)=c('Eigenvector','Closeness','Betweenness')

DFCentrality$person=row.names(DFCentrality)
row.names(DFCentrality)=NULL
DFCentrality
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2) #needed library

#create the correlation plot
ggplot(DFCentrality, aes(x=Betweenness, y=Closeness)) + 
    theme_classic() +
    geom_text(aes(label=person,size=Eigenvector),show.legend = T,alpha=0.5) 
```

- Al Pacino and Robert De Niro have the highest eigenvectors, so they are they most influential (they are connected to vertices that are also well connected).

- Tom Hanks has the highest closeness, so he can share information faster than the rest.

- Tom Hanks and Matt Damon have the highest betweenness, indicating that they are important to connect vertices that are not connected directly.


## IV. Communities

### IV.1 **Potential Communities?**

a. Computing a random network:

```{r}
#create a random network
RandomNet <- sample_gnp(length(V(actors)),p=edge_density(actors))
```

b. Get Transitivity rate

```{r}

#get the transitivity rate
transitivity(actors)/transitivity(RandomNet)
```
The above code shows that the transitivity of the actors network divided by the transitivity of a random network is less than 1.  Therefore, there is not evidence that there are potential communities.
